My first time creating a game mod. Got the idea to try out Lua, and as I owned a copy of Farming Simulator 22, and knew it used Lua. Thought to myself might as well take on a challenge.
I came up with the idea of doing a simple bird feeder, as a decorational object. But I also wanted to have birds, so at first I did not think much about the birds.
<br/> 
But when I was able to make a feeder function, I started to think about the birds and realized that I need some pathfinding capability.
So I ended up creating a set of scripts for the bird feeder mod, which includes a 3D octree grid, A* pathfinding and catmull-rom creation.

In the above video can be seen debugging on finished octree grid generation and update functionality, and initial A* pathfinding.

In the above video can be seen a more final version of A* in action with birds and catmull-rom splines.

My second mod for Farming Simulator 2022. I felt I needed to use the 3D pathfinding scripts that I created for previous bird mod for one more mod, so the best idea I got was to make a drone delivery mod.
This mod affects gameplay a lot more than previous "decorational" bird feeder, I would call this mod quite unique for FS22.

<br/> 
I created the drone, dronehub models and a pickup/delivery place with Blender. 
With some extensive testing and trying I managed to create the custom GUI for dronehub, as needed some way to configure the drones.
There was a huge amount of issues of creating something that I wanted not supported by the default game, which I solved. 
Ended up with over 20 new lua scripts for just this drone delivery mod not counting the pathfinding scripts even. 

Full features of this drone delivery is basically:
- Drone can carry all pallets, bales and bigbag types. 
- Placeable dronehub, pickup/delivery placeable. 
- Custom GUI to link/unlink drones, configure pickup and delivery route and route settings.
- Picking up and delivery can be done from any suitable factory/selling station/husbandry/ or the mod's pickup/delivery placeable. 
- Can basically automate completely anything to do with pallets.

My first time creating a game mod. Got the idea to try out Lua, and as I owned a copy of Farming Simulator 22, and knew it used Lua. Thought to myself might as well take on a challenge.

I came up with the idea of doing a simple bird feeder, as a decorational object. But I also wanted to have birds, so at first I did not think much about the birds. 
But when I was able to make a feeder function, I started to think about the birds and realized that I need some pathfinding capability.

So I ended up creating an octree and A* pathfinding. The functionality can be seen in the above video, thanks to some debugging functionality that I added.
This is still not ready yet for use, I made this pathfinding a separate mod from my bird feeder mod, so that it could be reused. 

What still remains is to do some path smoothing class, possibly some A* optimizations.

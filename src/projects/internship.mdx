<br/>
I did my internship between 15.09.2020-15.03.2021 at a company called NeXR Technologies which is located in Berlin.
This company specializes in VR software, motion capturing and 3D human scanners. 
<br/>
I worked in the VR software department.
Where I got to fix a bunch of existing bugs. I got to implement new features into a VR project using C++ in UE4.
I was the only programmer at the moment on one of the projects so I got to rather freely implement stuff and work independently. 
I really enjoyed my time there, and I most importantly got experience working in a tech company,
and learned new things about UE4 and coding in general.
This was also my first time in Berlin, but unfortunately due to larger presence of Covid-19 I barely got to see Berlin.

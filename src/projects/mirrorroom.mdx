In this video you can see what kind of game I was able to finish in a week. I ran out of time in the end, so this escape room does not have a lot of steps to complete.
<br/>
<br/>
I entered the Epic Games MegaJam 2022, which was a competition to create a game in a week.

The theme of the jam was "as above so below", so I came up with the idea to create a VR escape room that contains a room which is mirrored below to fit the theme.
I used only some free art assets and audio and music, the rest was done by me.
The core systems and interactions seen in the video were created in C++, and then for example the gameplay loop connecting everything together was just dirty made quickly in the level blueprint.
<br/>
<br/>

Perhaps I should have made a more simple game so I would have had more time for the game loop itself, most of the time went into programming the interactions and making the player class with states, physics enabled interaction, unique hand animations for objects and so on.

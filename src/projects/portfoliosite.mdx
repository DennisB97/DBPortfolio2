My previous portfolio site was also made using Gatsby. This site was one of my first sites that I've created.
I updated it once, which was a much needed improvement to the site. The project page originally was manually adding .js files for each project and repeating the same code within.
But now after ClickTracker and learning a bit more about React, I used .mdx files for each project page and dynamically creating these project pages.

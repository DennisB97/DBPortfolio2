This portfolio site was made using Gatsby. This is my third time creating a webpage from scratch, and second time creating a portfolio site for me.
With this site I changed up and used TypeScript instead of using JavaScript. But I still used same Gatsby framework. 
This time I chose to try and create something with some style, instead of just some gradient colors like the old portfolio site was.

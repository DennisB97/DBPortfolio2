Here in this video a skybox and some meshes are rendered using Vulkan API and using a simple UI created with dear imgui to toggle wireframe and hide meshes.

This was done on my free time, mainly learning more about Vulkan. 
This uses libraries like Vulkan memory allocator, dear imgui, glm and gltf for mesh loading.
